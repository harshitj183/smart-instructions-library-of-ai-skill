# 1. Review Flow

```mermaid

    A[Output Draft] --> B[Self-Review];
    B --> C[Logic Check];
    C --> D[Security Audit];
    D --> E[Persona Consistency];
    E --> F[Final Submission];
```

# 1. Review Request Logic
When requesting review (from a human or another AI):
- **PR Summary**: List changed files and their logical impact.
- **Critical Points**: Explicitly point out complex logic or sensitive changes.
- **Context Pack**: Provide the `SKILL.md` rules and the current `status_summary.md` as context.

# 2. Receiving Review Logic
When processing feedback:
1. **Analyze**: Categorize by Impact (Critical, Minor, Nit).
2. **Respond**: Acknowledge each point and provide the reasoning behind the fix.
3. **Fix**: Use the `tdd_mastery.md` skill to safely implement any changes.
4. **Verify**: Run the full test suite again.

# 3. Quality Metrics
- Zero-defect code.
- No regression.
- Performance impact <1%.
