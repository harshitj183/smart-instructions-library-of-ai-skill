# 1. Implementation Protocol
- **Zero Drift**: Follow the plan exactly. Do NOT improve, change, or skip any step unless it is logically impossible.
- **Progress Reporting**: Check off each step as you complete it. Use the `history/` system for tracking.

# 2. Execution Protocol

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Receive Plan] --> B{Valid?};
    B -- No --> C[Request Revision];
    B -- Yes --> D[Execute Next Step];
    D --> E[Verify Output];
    E -- Fail --> F[Retry/Adjust];
    E -- Pass --> G{More Steps?};
    G -- Yes --> D;
    G -- No --> H[Complete Task];
```

# 3. Execution Logic
1. **Initialize**: Load all files listed in the step's "Context" first.
2. **Execute**: Perform the code change or terminal command.
3. **Verify**: Run a test or manual check as per the definition of done.
4. **Finalize**: Commit the step's history and move to the next.

# 3. Branching/Error Logic
- If a step fails, **pause**. Do not try to workaround. Update the plan's Risk Map and inform the Coordinator/User.
