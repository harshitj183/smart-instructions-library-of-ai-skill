# 🤖 AI History Maintenance Skill

This skill provides mandatory instructions for AI agents working on the `@harshitj183/ai-skills` project to maintain project history and transparency.

---

## 🧐 Skill Summary
Empowers AI agents to systematically document their actions, changes, and milestones within the project's dedicated `history/` system.

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

### 1. Mandatory Updates
After completing any major task (e.g., adding a new skill, fixing a bug, updating configurations), you **MUST** update the following files:
- **`history/ai_activity_log.md`**: Add your AI name, date, and a bulleted list of tasks performed.
- **`history/project_timeline.md`**: Add major date-stamped events if applicable.
- **`history/version_history.md`**: If the task warrants a version bump, record the new version and its features.
- **`history/milestones.md`**: If the task is a major breakthrough, add it to the milestones.

### 2. Format and Tone
- Use professional, clear markdown.
- Maintain a structured, reverse-chronological order (newest on top).
- Include dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` or `Month DD, YYYY` format.
- Always sign the update with `*Last updated by: AI Assistant (<Name>)*`.

### 3. Verification
Before concluding any session, verify that:
- The `history/` directory contains accurate and recent records of your work.
- The `history/status_summary.md` links are still valid.

## 🌟 Best Practices
- **Proactive Documentation**: If you see a gap in history, fill it immediately.
- **Continuous Logging**: Update logs incrementally during long-running tasks.
- **Context Awareness**: Use previous logs to understand why certain decisions were made.
