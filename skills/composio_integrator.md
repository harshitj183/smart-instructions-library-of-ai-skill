# Integration Guidelines
1. **Authentication Handling:** Never expose OAuth keys directly. Rely entirely on Composio's managed authentication gateway via the Composio Plugin.
2. **Entity Management:** Whenever triggering cross-platform actions (e.g., Salesforce to Jira), link requests using fixed Composio `entity_id` values.
3. **Action Triggers:** Do not guess the API schemas. Use Composio's SDK `composio.executeAction(Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE, { ... })` for strongly-typed integrations.

# Security
- Ensure strict least-privilege scoping when generating the Composio connection links.
- Treat every response payload as untrusted and sanitize before feeding into downstream actions.
